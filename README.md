HostsEditor
============

Tool to help change between different hosts.

At some time, you may want to change your hosts(C:\Windows\System32\Drivers\Etc\Hosts) between two or more configs.

For example, you want www.example.com to be resolved as 222.222.222.222, and after a while, you want it to be 333.333.333.333. In old days, we do this in manually wan, which is time-wasting and boring.

Now you have **HostsEditor**, by which you can add/edit/remove/resotre/apply hosts config.
